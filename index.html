        <p> JieQi is a Master of Science student in Environmental Policy and Management (EPM). She graduated
            from California State University, Fullerton, with a B.S. in Geological Sciences. While in CSUF, she
            was selected as LSAMP (Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation) Research Scholar to
            describe and analyze an eight-million-year-old dolphin from Orange County, CA. From 2021-2022, she
            interned at UltraSystems Environmental Inc. in Irvine, CA, to gain experience implementing the
            California Environmental Quality Act and the National Environmental Policy Act by preparing various
            reports. </p>
        <p> She is currently interested in specializing in environmental hazard mitigation. Under the Ted
            Bradshaw Engaged Student Scholars Program, she works with Marin City Climate Resilience and Health
            Justice to engage community members and conduct community-based needs assessments to understand the
            flood, water, and soil pollution issues manifest from the community's perspective. Shortly, she will
            begin her GSR position with the EPM program and a summer internship with the California Governor's
            Office of Strategic Growth Council. </p>
