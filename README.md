## Jekyll

Everything on this website uses the Jekyll engine. Most changes to the content only require you to upload a new file in the `/assets/` folder if you want to add a new file and then add the change to the relevant `.yml` file in the `/_data/` folder so that Jekyll knows where things are and what new content to add to the website.
